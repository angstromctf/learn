title:  "Modern Cryptography"
---

Modern cryptography refers to cryptosystems that use algorithms to decode and encode data. The underlying concept is the same - we want to exchange sensitive information in a secure manner. We'll look at how these algorithms encode and decode data, as well as how some of them are vulnerable.

We consider the first "Modern Cryptosystem" to be DES, the **Data Encryption Standard**. Developed by IBM in the 1970's, it responded to NIST's call for a standard encryption algorithm for data.
