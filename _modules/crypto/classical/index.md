title: "Classical Cryptography"
---

If you take a look at cryptography throughout history, you'll see that it's divided into two major periods, based on time: **classical cryptography** up until the 1970s, and **modern cryptography** after that. The field took a quantum leap with the introduction of new algorithms and cryptosystems such as the Data Encryption Standard (*DES*), Rivest-Shamir-Adleman public-key algorithm (*RSA*), and *Diffie-Hellman key exchange*, rendering old techniques obsolete and almost trivial to defeat with modern computational power. However, it's still instructive to look at them and learn a lot of the terminology and basic ideas, which are the same as those that underlie modern cryptography.

The major focus of classical cryptography (and modern cryptography) was (and is) **encryption**: Alice transforming a secret message, the **plaintext**, into a scrambled or *encrypted* form, called the **ciphertext**, using a **secret key**. The ciphertext can then be decoded, or **decrypted**, when it gets to Bob, preventing Eve from obtaining the information, as long as Bob knows the key and Eve doesn't. This type of cryptosystem is called a **cipher**. Classical ciphers can generally be divided into two major types: **substitution ciphers**, which is a fancy way of saying ciphers that switch letters for other letters, and **transposition ciphers**, which swap around the order of the letters. The goal of these ciphers is to resist **cryptanalysis**: smart people using math to try to reverse the encryption without knowing the key.

Now, this might just seem like a lot of vocab we're throwing at you that you don't really understand. In the remainder of this section, we'll introduce important examples of classical cryptosystems, and you'll see these terms in action!
