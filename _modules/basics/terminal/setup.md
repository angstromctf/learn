title: Getting Set Up With Terminal
order: 1
---
If you're on a Mac, you're in luck - OS X is derived from UNIX, so you already have a functioning Unix terminal. ``âŒ˜ Command``+``Space`` and search Terminal, and you'll get to it.

If you're on Linux, Unix, BSD, or something similar, you probably don't need this guide.

If you're on Windows, you've got some work to do. Microsoft had its own command line interface in the early days, called DOS(Disk Operating System). DOS is almost totally different from Unix. Not many people program for DOS. Besides, DOS is much harder to do anything in DOS than in Unix<sup>[Citation Needed](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cessna_Citation_family)</sup>. Now, to get a Unix terminal on Windows, a few different options exist. If you're ambitious, you could dual boot a Linux distro. Find a guide [here](http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/dual-boot-ubuntu-15-04-14-10-and-windows-10-8-1-8-step-by-step-tutorial-with-screenshots). 

The easier method is to set up a Unix-style terminal on your Windows computer. **Cygwin** is probably the best, find a link [here](https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/cygwin/). Follow the instructions to install Cygwin. This will set up a Unix-like terminal on your computer, and you'll have most, if not all, of the standard Unix functions. Alternatives include MinGW and using our webshell.
