When you're a child, you use a computer by the pictures. When you grow up, you learn to read and write.

You've probably heard of *the terminal* from someone before. Maybe they told you it was something magical that could do magical things. Well cheer up! This chapter will demystify the terminal and its use!!

But first... A bit of history.


## **UNIX**

Way way way back in the 1970's, operating systems weren't like they were today. Most of them were proprietary, meaning companies sold licenses of them to customers. This is like what Windows or OS X is - you don't actually own the operating system - you own a license to use it. Back then, AT&T and Bell Labs developed one such proprietary OS - UNIX. Now, UNIX could have died out, but it didn't. UNIX now forms the basis for many different OSes, including your Mac and iPhone. This link [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg) shows you a tree of all Unix operating systems.


### **Text Based Interaction**
To interact with these early operating systems, you didn't have a *graphical user interface*, like you do today. There wasn't a mouse to move, no buttons to click, no spinning beach balls to watch. There was only the command line. Instead of clicking on things, you typed in specific commands to tell your computer to do things. It's kind of like commanding your pet to do something. You could tell your dog to "Fetch the newspaper", for example. Likewise, you could command a computer to "Show me all of the files in this folder".

Many people, especially computer programmers, prefer the command line interface to the graphical one. It's much faster, more resource efficient, and makes you look damn cool. Case in point:

The way cool people work.
