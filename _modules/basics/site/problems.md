title: Problems and Points
order: 1
---
The main part of this competition is answering the problems that we give to you. You can find all the problems under the Problems tab. All problems have four parts:
* The problem name
* The point value
* The question, which will include problem files
* A hint

Problems are listed in increasing order of difficulty. Higher point values correspond to harder problems. The problems towards the beginning can be solved with some simple resources and less than 15 minutes of effort. Problems towards the end may require many hours of hard work to solve. angstromCTF assumes no responsibility for any objects destroyed during this competition, including but not limited to your sanity.

To solve the problem, you will have to do various tasks to get the flag. The flag will be formatted as ``angstromCTF{flag}`` unless otherwise stated. Once you get the flag, paste or type it into the flag box for the problem and hit submit. If you got the right flag, congrats! A green box will appear and tell you that you solved the problem. If you didn't get it right, you will see a red box with "Incorrect" written in it. All of the flags are **salted**. No, they are not very angry, rather they have three or four random hex values. Thus, if the text flag was ``hi_im_a_flag``, the actual flag would be ``angstromCTF{0x230x430x92hi_im_a_flag}``. This ensures it is nearly impossible to guess flags, because that just isn't any fun. Flag text relates to the problem somehow, but other than that is totally arbitrary.

Now, here's a sample problem:

**Caesar Salad: 20 Points**

Hmmm.... I wonder what this means. Can you help me understand it?
``hunzayvtJAM{234432op_dlsjvtl_av_hunzayvt}``

(Submit box) (Hint box)

We see this problem has all four parts - a name, a point value, a question, and a hint. Clicking on the hint button reveals the hint. We believe that hints are a useful aid to solving problems if you are stuck, so you will never receive penalties for using hints. However, be warned - for more difficult problems, the hints may be cryptic or simply `"No hint :>"`.


**TL;DR**: Our website has problems. They tell you to get a flag, of the form ``angstromctf{(random bytes)(some flag text)}``. Sometimes there are hints, sometimes not.
