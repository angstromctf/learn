Our website has three basic components:
1. The Navigation Bar
2. The main content area
3. The footer

The navigation bar is what you'll use to find your way around the site. This links to every major component of our website. Here are the components:
* Our Logo - This brings you back to the homepage.
* About - Learn about the project and the motivation behind it.
* Sponsors - Our generous sponsors, without which this would not have been possible.
* Updates - Possibly the most important tab. Here we post important announcements and updates regarding problems and competition dates.
* Problems - Problems! Go here to get and solve problems.
* Scoreboard - A list of all teams in order of highest score. Can you rise to the top?
* Chat - A kiwi IRC page. This allows you to ask questions to whoever is on the chat, whether it be moderators or other friendly competitors.
* Account - Edit your information, create, join, or leave teams, and much more.
* Login/Register - Login to your account, or register for an account.

All content is displayed below the menubar and above the header. Everything should be nice and readable. If you find anything that is broken, tell a moderator! Contact us through email(bugs@angstromctf.com) or the IRC chat, and we may give you some extra points.

Our footer contains links to our social media accounts, where you can find updates about angstromCTF. You can also find a link to our website source on Github. Finally, you'll find a link to the page of one of our very generous sponsors, DigitalOcean.
